# swww script
A python script for swww
If you have any issues or want to improve the code, feel free to make a issue <3
I might add animation support in the future

# Usage
1. Create swww.py anywhere you want, and paste the contents from the github into it. (I cant get git clone to work)
2. In swww.py, change wall_path to the path to your folder with wallpapers, and change interval to how many minutes to wait before randomizing a new wallpaper, or None to not change it.

# Startup
It is reccomened to add the script to startup, for hyprland, add exec-once = /path/to/swww.py
